DeployedAt
==========

A Rails plugin for storing information about each deploy. You need a running
deployed_at server: http://github.com/theflow/deployed_at

Installation
============

This is basically just the capistrano task to hook it into the deploy. Make
sure you have this line in your Capfile

    Dir['vendor/plugins/*/recipes/*.rb'].each { |plugin| load(plugin) }

Then you need to define the deployed_at server endpoint in your deploy.rb:

    set :deployedit_server, 'http://www.example.org:4567'

Finally hook the task into your deploy cycle:

    before "deploy:update_code", "deploy:remember"

That's it.
